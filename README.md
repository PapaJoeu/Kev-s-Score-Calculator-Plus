# Kev's Scoring Calculator

**Kev's Scoring Calculator** is a simple, browser-based tool designed to help print professionals and press operators quickly determine precise scoring measurements for multiple documents laid out on a larger sheet.  

This tool is especially useful for jobs like folded business cards, postcards, or other small folded items that don‚Äôt feed well through a scoring machine once cut down to their final size. By calculating and visualizing scoring positions before cutting, you can run and score the larger parent sheet reliably and efficiently.

## üéØ Purpose

In print production, small folded pieces (like folded business cards) can be difficult to score after being cut because they are too small to feed properly. This calculator solves that problem by:
- Allowing you to plan scoring on the full sheet before cutting  
- Ensuring accurate placement for scores across multiple documents  
- Reducing waste and rework due to misaligned scores
